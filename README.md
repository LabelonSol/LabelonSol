Introducing Label on Sol: Revolutionizing the Music Industry

Label on Sol is a record label project built on the Solana blockchain, poised to redefine the relationship between artists and labels. Our mission is to empower artists globally by providing fair compensation, unprecedented transparency, and unparalleled support.

Revenue Allocation Model:
We believe in prioritizing artists' well-being and creativity. Therefore, we allocate 60% of the revenue generated from songs directly to the artists, ensuring they receive the lion's share of their hard work. The remaining 40% is allocated to Label holding, facilitating the growth and sustainability of our platform.

Token Economy:
Label on sol utilizes a token-based economy to revolutionize artist compensation and support initiatives. We reinvest revenue to buy back tokens from the market, which are then utilized to compensate artists, fund collaborations with existing artists, organize global events, promote Label, hire animators and video producers, and facilitate airdropping events.

Tokenomics:
Our token has a maximum supply of 1 billion, ensuring stability and long-term viability. Token holders play an integral role in decision-making processes through our Discord platform, where they vote on potential artists to sign. Artists, in turn, submit their songs for consideration, with the most voted artist being signed and announced via Twitter.

Community Engagement:
We foster a vibrant community through frequent airdrops to those who actively promote Label on Sol and its artists on social media platforms. This incentivizes organic growth and rewards supporters for their advocacy.

Empowering Artists:
Label on Sol is committed to providing artists with unprecedented opportunities and support. By treating artists with respect and transparency, we aim to set a new standard for the industry, ensuring that artists thrive and are valued for their contributions.


Publishing procedures.:

Community Selection: Token holders on our Discord platform participate in voting for songs they wish to be published. This ensures that our community has a voice in the selection process, fostering a sense of ownership and involvement.

Artist Decision: Once the voting period ends and a song is chosen, the artist has the freedom to decide how they want to present their work. They can opt for a music video, hire an animator for visual content, or simply publish the track with its cover art. This flexibility empowers artists to express themselves authentically.

Publication and Announcement: After the decision is made, the chosen song is published on existing platforms such as Spotify, Youtube, Soundcloud, Anghami etc. We announce the release on Twitter, leveraging our social media presence to reach a wider audience and generate buzz around the artist and their work.

Community Promotion: Our community plays an integral role in promoting the published song. Together, we collaborate to share the music across various platforms, amplifying its reach and impact. This approach not only supports the artist but also strengthens our community bonds.

Third-Party Promotions: In addition to community-driven promotion, we use Label holdings to invest in third-party promotion services. This strategic approach enhances visibility and exposure, further expanding the audience for our artists' music.

Revenue Distribution:
Following the publication and promotion of a song, revenue generated is distributed as follows:

60% to the artist, ensuring they receive a fair share of the earnings from their work.
40% to the Label, supporting ongoing operations, artist development, and community initiatives.

Join Label on Sol as we embark on a journey to reshape the music industry, one artist at a time. 

Label on Sol is not just a record label; it's a movement dedicated to transforming the music industry from the ground up. Our approach prioritizes artists' rights, fair compensation, and community collaboration, setting a new standard for the industry.
